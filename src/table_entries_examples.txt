---- CHARACTER ----
{"idx":8,"id":"78700f6d-11a7-4ae0-ab50-a1a1b498c1d7","type":"character","name":"Kaedin","description":"Kaedin was born in the mining village of Grackledorn, carved into the rugged ridges of the Earthspur Mountains near the edge of the Great Rift. The land there thrummed with old power, remnants of a time when a mighty Dao genie once struck a pact with the mountain dwarves, leaving the region steeped in latent elemental magic. Though his parents were human, Kaedin's body and soul were forever marked by this place-born of stone and thunder, forged in silence and shifting earth.\n\nAs a child, Kaedin was clever, energetic, and always on the verge of mischief. His constant partner in trouble was Thalos, the son of stoic, deeply religious Earth Genasi parents who upheld every tradition with unwavering reverence. Thalos always wore his people's ceremonial robes, stiff with cultural pride and stitched with sacred patterns of stone. Kaedin mocked them at first-he found them impractical, absurd for cave diving and running through the hills. But Thalos never cared what Kaedin thought; he wore them because they meant something.\n\nOne fateful day, at only ten years old, the two friends ventured into a newly revealed tunnel in the cliffs beyond the village. The air inside was sharp with arcane charge, and the walls glittered with strange, glowing crystal veins. In the heart of that cave, they found an ancient monolith-a beacon of pure energy, covered in glowing symbols Kaedin would one day recognize as belonging to the Kryn Dynasty.\n\nTheir laughter and arguing masked the danger until it was too late. A pressure plate clicked beneath Thalos's foot, and the beacon flared to life. Dunamis energy surged through the cavern, and before Kaedin could act, Thalos was consumed by the pulse-his form collapsing into a shimmer of light before vanishing entirely. Only his robes remained, crumpled on the stone floor. The village assumed Thalos had been lost in a cave-in. But Kaedin knew the truth: something had taken his friend beyond the boundaries of their world.\n\nIn the months that followed, Kaedin began to experience disturbing visions. He would seize up with piercing headaches, and during those moments, the world seemed to warp-reflections of himself flickered across the edges of his sight, and time stuttered like a skipped breath. He saw himself fighting battles he hadn't lived, speaking words he'd never learned. He was seeing alternate versions of his life-echoes.\n\nDesperate for answers, Kaedin eventually traveled east, following rumors of Kryn exiles who had continued their study of dunamancy in secret. In the shadowy tunnels beneath Velkynvelve, he found them-arcane researchers, deserters, and mystics. One of them, a wizened mage named Verenn Yorr, recognized the potential in Kaedin's unstable visions and offered to help. Under Verenn's guidance, Kaedin learned to harness the rifts within himself. He trained to stabilize the echoes and turn them into extensions of his will-shadows of himself pulled from other timelines, weapons shaped from the possibilities of his own existence.\n\nWith discipline and will, he became something new: an Echo Knight, a warrior with one foot planted in every version of reality. Kaedin joined a soldier's company not long after, hoping to gain the discipline and experience to master his strange powers. But he never stopped searching. He wore Thalos's traditional Earth Genasi robes over his armor, adapting them to his style: long black cloaks with golden trims, chainmail hidden beneath flowing earthen fabric. The other soldiers mocked his appearance, seeing only a mystic trying to play at being a knight. That laughter quickly died on the training grounds.\n\nKaedin never tried to correct their assumptions. He remained quiet, direct, and solitary. Many mistook his reserved nature for a lack of charisma, but Kaedin had long since abandoned social rituals. Every word, every action, was weighed for purpose. He did not fight for glory or gold-he fought to control the powers of fate, to learn how to step through time itself, and to find the one timeline where Thalos still lived.\n\nKaedin had been tracing reports of arcane disturbances-instances where individuals claimed to have seen visions of themselves acting out moments that hadn't yet occurred. Whispers of these strange anomalies led him west, to the Elsir Vale, a land scattered with ruins of ancient civilizations and known for its thin veil between worlds. Rumors in Dennovar spoke of a ruined fortress to the north where the walls shimmered at night and shadows moved without a source.\n\nHe arrived in Brindol, the Vale's largest city, under the guise of a wandering soldier-scholar, seeking tomes and local accounts of planar rifts. His presence, though quiet, didn't go unnoticed for long.\n\nWhen goblin raids intensified, Kaedin stepped in to defend a merchant caravan during a sudden ambush. His command of echo magic-blinking in and out of reality, fighting alongside his own shadows-left survivors stunned. Word of the strange warrior reached Lord Jarmaath of Brindol, who was desperate for capable allies as tensions in the region worsened.\n\nTheir agreement was simple: Kaedin would scout the threat in the wilds surrounding Brindol, confirm the reports of a united goblinoid force, identify the warlord behind it, and uncover what their endgame was.\n\nBut for Kaedin, there was more to it than a mission. He had heard rumors that the warlord, used strange tactics-ambushes that unfolded like they had foreseen their enemies' every move. It could have been coincidence. Or it could be another sign of dunamancy at work.","campaign_id":"415036c7-08cc-4832-bfec-6daca13e3f8a","created_at":"2025-11-19 19:06:51.037365+00","attributes":"{\"icon\": [{\"id\":

Members of thieves' guild often served one of the following roles, which were divided into divisions in larger guilds: assassins, beggars, bounty hunters, burglars, con artists and tricksters, cutpurses and pickpockets, enforcers and thugs, racketeers, scouts and spies, and fences, smugglers, and pirates.
